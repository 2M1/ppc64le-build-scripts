Test Failure Analysis (TF-1.3.1 on RHEL With CPU Support)

* We have fixed all the ppc64le related test failures in build script.
* After executing tests, you will get other 7 failures , see below -

* This test was failing with "bazel test" command (i.e. from inside the TF source code) , 
however it's passing with TensorFlow API  (i.e. using "import tensorflow as tf"), 
tried in sample code using inputs equivalent to ones used in test case and using respective 
TF API i.e. tf.<function_name>)
1.	//tensorflow/compiler/tests:binary_ops_test_cpu

* This test is failing due to "xla_backend_extra_options=xla_cpu_parallel" deprecated feature 
and community planning to disable the tests that use this option.
2.	//tensorflow/compiler/xla/tests:array_elementwise_ops_test_cpu_parallel


* Following tests are passing with numpy==1.12.0 (default installed version is 1.14.3). 
3.	//tensorflow/python/debug:curses_ui_test     
4.	//tensorflow/python/debug:tensor_format_test  

* 5. To pass //tensorflow/tools/api/tests:api_compatibility_test run below command :
       bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/api/tests/api_compatibility_test --update_goldens True          
        
* Below 2 tests are passing in higher version of TF without any changes i.e.TF 1.6.0 :
6.	//tensorflow/python/kernel_tests:fft_ops_test 
7.	//tensorflow/contrib/signal:spectral_ops_test

      
Additional information:

After executing "bazel test" command, you might see some other test failures. 
Please re-run these failed tests and they will succeed.
