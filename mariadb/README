Many distros already have MariaDB so install from there using usual distro tools.

If you want a later release/version, for:
* Centos 7
* Redhat EL 7
* Ubuntu (LTS releases - only) - 18.04 packages coming after they the version release for ppc64le (https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-16138)
* Debian (8 & 9)
 
... go to https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/repositories and follow the instructions there.
