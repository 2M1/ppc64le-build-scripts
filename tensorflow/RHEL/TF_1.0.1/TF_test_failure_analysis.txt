Test Failure Analysis (TF-1.0.1  on RHEL7.3 With GPU Support )

Total 13 tests were failing on ppc64le, and we have fixed all of them 
(12 failures observed with/without GPU support and 1 additional 
failure observed with GPU support)

12 failures observed with/without GPU support, we have analyzed/fixed 
these test failures, as per the analysis we classified the failures 
as follows

* Have patches for following 8 FAILED tests
1.	//tensorflow/python/kernel_tests:cast_op_test 
2.	//tensorflow/python/kernel_tests:summary_image_op_test
3.	//tensorflow/python/kernel_tests:linalg_grad_test
4.	//tensorflow/core:platform_profile_utils_cpu_utils_test 
5.	//tensorflow/core/kernels:sparse_matmul_op_test_gpu
6.	//tensorflow/python/kernel_tests:sparse_matmul_op_test
7.	 //tensorflow/tools/test:cast_op_benchmark  
8.	//tensorflow/tools/test:rnn_op_benchmark


* This test is passing in TF1.3.1 release (without any changes)
9.	//tensorflow/compiler/tests:pooling_ops_test_cpu  

* This test was failing on RHEL7.3 vm. Now this machine upgraded to RHEL7.4. 
I reran "image_ops_test" test on new OS and test passed successfully without 
any changes.
10.	//tensorflow/contrib/image:image_ops_test  

* These 2 tests were failing with "bazel test" command (i.e. from inside the 
  TF source code) , however both are passing with TensorFlow API's (i.e. using 
  "import tensorflow as tf"), tried in sample code using inputs equivalent to
  ones used in test case and using respective TF API i.e. tf.<function_name>)
11.	//tensorflow/compiler/tests:ternary_ops_test_cpu
12.	//tensorflow/compiler/tests:binary_ops_test_cpu

	
* One addition failure observed with GPU support 
13.	//tensorflow/python:function_test : This test is fixed in TF1.1.0
        release.

* Some addition notes about GPU support:
- Three tests are not compatible with GPU (specifically not in the gpu-enabled
  test set), we need to run these tests without GPU-support, and name of these
  tests are as follows: 
1.	//tensorflow/contrib/tensor_forest:scatter_add_ndim_op_test
2.	//tensorflow/core:ops_math_grad_test
3.	//tensorflow/python:session_test

Community working to support these tests on GPUs

* After executing all tests using
  "bazel test --config=opt --config=cuda -k --jobs 1 //tensorflow/..."
  command , you might get some test failures with following errors:
1	CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY
2	Couldn't open CUDA library libcupti.so.8.0. LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
3	Platform CUDA present but no XLA compiler available: could not find
        registered compiler for platform CUDA
4	TIMEOUT issue

Action: Rerunning these failed tests will help to pass them. Before re-running
first set following ENV variables: 

#1 Set PATH for Bazel (as per your bazel binary location)
PATH=/$wdir/bazel/output:$PATH

#2 Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH for libcupti.so.8.0 library

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" 

#3 Individually rerun failed tests from TensorFlow source code directory i.e.
   cd  /TF-dir/  &&  \
   bazel test --config=opt --config=cuda -k --jobs 1 <test_name>
