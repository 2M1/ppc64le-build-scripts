Test Failure Analysis (TF-1.2.1 on SLES12 SP2 With CPU Support)

Total 19 tests fail on ppc64le, and we have analyzed/fixed these test failures.

As per analysis failures are classified as follows.

* We have created the patches for following 11 FAILED tests
  1.    //tensorflow/core:platform_profile_utils_cpu_utils_test
  2.    //tensorflow/python/kernel_tests:linalg_grad_test
  3.    //tensorflow/python/kernel_tests:cast_op_test
  4.    //tensorflow/contrib/lookup:lookup_ops_test
  5.    //tensorflow/python/kernel_tests:lookup_ops_test
  6.    //tensorflow/python/kernel_tests:string_to_hash_bucket_op_test
  7.    //tensorflow/python:nn_test
  8.    //tensorflow/python/kernel_tests:summary_image_op_test
  9.    //tensorflow/python/kernel_tests:denormal_test
  10.   //tensorflow/core/kernels:sparse_matmul_op_test_gpu
  11.   //tensorflow/python/kernel_tests:sparse_matmul_op_test

* Following test is passing in TF1.3.1 release (without any changes)
  12.   //tensorflow/compiler/tests:pooling_ops_test_cpu  

* Following 2 tests were failing with "bazel test" command (i.e. from inside
  the TF source code), however both are passing with TensorFlow APIs
  (i.e. using "import tensorflow as tf"), tried on sample code using inputs
  equivalent to ones used in test case and using respective TF API
  (i.e. tf.<function_name>)
  13.   //tensorflow/compiler/tests:ternary_ops_test_cpu
  14.   //tensorflow/compiler/tests:binary_ops_test_cpu

* Following test is failing due to 'xla_backend_extra_options=xla_cpu_parallel'
  which is now a deprecated feature and community is planning to disable tests
  which use this option.
  15.   //tensorflow/compiler/xla/tests:array_elementwise_ops_test_cpu_parallel

* Following tests are passing with numpy==1.12.0
  (default installed version is 1.14.0). 
  16.   //tensorflow/python/debug:curses_ui_test     
  17.   //tensorflow/python/debug:tensor_format_test  
  18.   //tensorflow/python:special_math_ops_test    

* In order to execute //tensorflow/python/kernel_tests:svd_op_test
  successfully, run below commands:
      zypper remove  python2-numpy python2-numpy-devel
      zypper install python2-numpy python2-numpy-devel

* Additional information:

After executing "bazel test" command, you might see some other test failures.
Please re-run these failed tests and they will succeed.
